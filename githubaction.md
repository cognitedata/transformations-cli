# `transformations-cli` GitHub Action

`transformations-cli` also provides a GitHub Action, which can be used to deploy transformations.

1. Create transformation manifests and place them into a folder structure in your repository.

## Transformation manifests

Important notes:
- When a scheduled transformation is represented in a manifest without schedule provided, deploy will delete the existing schedule.

- When an existing notification is not provided along with the transformation to be updated, notification will be deleted.

- Values specified as `${VALUE}` are treated as environment variables while `VALUE` is directly used as the actual value.

- Old jetfire-cli style manifests can be used by adding `legacy: true` inside the old manifest.

- The manifest directory is scanned recursively for `*.yml` and `*.yaml` files, so you can organize your transformations into separate subdirectories.

### Manifest with OIDC Credentials

```yaml
# Required
externalId: "test-cli-transform-oidc"
# Required
name: "test-cli-transform-oidc"

# Required
# Valid values are: "assets", "timeseries", "asset_hierarchy", events", "datapoints", 
# "string_datapoints", "sequences", "files", "labels", "relationships",
# "raw", "data_sets", "sequence_rows"
destination: 
  type: "assets"

# destination: "assets"

# When writing to RAW tables, use the following syntax:
# destination:
#   type: raw
#   rawDatabase: some_database
#   rawTable: some_table

# When writing to sequence rows, use the following syntax:
# destination:
#   type: sequence_rows
#   externalId: some_sequence

# Optional, default: true
shared: true

# Optional, default: upsert
# Valid values are:
#   upsert: Create new items, or update existing items if their id or externalId
#           already exists.
#   create: Create new items. The transformation will fail if there are id or
#           externalId conflicts.
#   update: Update existing items. The transformation will fail if an id or 
#           externalId does not exist.
#   delete: Delete items by internal id.
action: "upsert"

# Required
query: "select 'My Assets Transformation' as name, 'asset1' as externalId"

# Or the path to a file containing the SQL query for this transformation.
# query:
#   file: query.sql

# Optional, default: null
# If null, the transformation will not be scheduled.
schedule: "* * * * *"
# Or you can pause the schedules.
# schedule:
#   interval: "* * * * *"
#   isPaused: true

# Optional, default: true
ignoreNullFields: false

# Optional, default: null
# List of email adresses to send emails to on transformation errors
notifications:
  - example@cognite.com
  - example2@cognite.com

# Optional, default: null
# Skipping this field or providing null clears
# the data set ID on updating the transformation
dataSetId: 1

# Or you can provide data set external ID instead,
# Optional, default: null
# Skipping this field or providing null clears
# the data set ID on updating the transformation
dataSetExternalId: test-dataset

# Optional: You can tag your transformations with max 5 tags.
tags:
  - mytag1

# The client credentials to be used in the transformation
authentication:
  clientId: ${CLIENT_ID}
  clientSecret: ${CLIENT_SECRET}
  tokenUrl: ${TOKEN_URL}
  scopes: 
    - ${SCOPES}
  cdfProjectName: ${CDF_PROJECT_NAME}
  # audience: ""

# If you need to specify read/write credentials separately
# authentication:
#   read:

#     scopes: 
#       - ${SCOPES}
#     cdfProjectName: ${CDF_PROJECT_NAME}
#     # audience: ""
```

### Manifest with API keys

```yaml
   externalId: "test-cli-transform"
   name: "test-cli-transform"
   destination: 
   type: "assets"
   shared: true
   action: "upsert"
   query: "select 'My Assets Transformation' as name, 'asset1' as externalId"
   # query:
   #   file: query.sql
   schedule: "* * * * *"
   ignoreNullFields: false
   notifications:
    - example@cognite.com
    - example2@cognite.com

  # Optional, default: null
  # Skipping this field or providing null clears
  # the data set ID on updating the transformation
  dataSetId: 1

  # Or you can provide data set external ID instead,
  # Optional, default: null
  # Skipping this field or providing null clears
  # the data set ID on updating the transformation
  dataSetExternalId: test-dataset

  # Optional: You can tag your transformations with max 5 tags.
  tags:
    - mytag1
    - mytag2

  authentication:
   apiKey: ${API_KEY}

   # # If you need to specity read/write authentication separately
   # authentication:
   #   read:
   #     apiKey: ${API_KEY}
   #   write:
   #     apiKey: ${API_KEY}
```

2. To deploy a set of transformations in a GitHub workflow, add a step which references the Action in your job.

## Deploy step with OIDC credentials

Alternatively when using OIDC, the Action needs the client details instead of `api-key`:
```yaml
- name: Deploy transformations
  uses: cognitedata/transformations-cli@main
  env:
      # Credentials to be used when running your transformations,
      # as referenced in your manifests:
      COGNITE_CLIENT_ID: my-cognite-client-id
      COGNITE_CLIENT_SECRET: ${{ secrets.cognite_client_secret }}
  with:
      # Credentials used for deployment
      path: transformations  # Transformation manifest folder, relative to GITHUB_WORKSPACE
      client-id: my-jetfire-client-id
      client-secret: ${{ secrets.jetfire_client_secret] }}
      token-url: https://login.microsoftonline.com/<my-azure-tenant-id>/oauth2/v2.0/token
      cdf-project-name: my-project-name
      # If you need to provide multiple scopes, the format: "scope1 scope2 scope3"
      scopes: https://<my-cluster>.cognitedata.com/.default
      # audience: "" # Optional
```

This GitHub Action takes the following inputs:

| Name      | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `path`    | _(Required)_ The path to a directory containing transformation manifests. This is relative to `$GITHUB_WORKSPACE`, which will be the root of the repository when using [actions/checkout](https://github.com/actions/checkout) with default settings. |
| `client-id` | _(Required)_ The CLIENT ID used for authenticating with transformations. Equivalent to setting the `TRANSFORMATIONS_CLIENT_ID` environment variable. |
| `client-secret` | _(Required)_ The CLIENT SECRET used for authenticating with transformations. Equivalent to setting the `TRANSFORMATIONS_CLIENT_SECRET` environment variable. |
| `token-url` | _(Required)_ The TOKEN URL used for requesting token to authenticate with transformations. Equivalent to setting the `TRANSFORMATIONS_TOKEN_URL` environment variable. |
| `cdf-project-name` | _(Required)_ Equivalent to setting the `TRANSFORMATIONS_PROJECT` environment variable. |
| `scopes` | _(Optional)_ The SCOPES used for authenticating with transformations. Equivalent to setting the `TRANSFORMATIONS_SCOPES` environment variable. Space separated if multiple needed. |
| `audience` | _(Optional)_ The AUDIENCE used for authenticating with transformations. Equivalent to setting the `TRANSFORMATIONS_AUDIENCE` environment variable. |
| `cluster` | _(Optional)_ The name of the cluster where Transformations is hosted. Equivalent to setting the `TRANSFORMATIONS_CLUSTER` environment variable. |

Additionally, you must specify environment variables for any credentials or environment variables referenced in transformation manifests.

## Deploy step with API keys

```yaml

  uses: cognitedata/transformations-cli@main
  with:
    path: transformations # Transformation manifest folder, relative to GITHUB_WORKSPACE
    api-key: ${{ secrets.TRANSFORMATIONS_API_KEY }}
    # If not using the main europe-west1-1 cluster:
    # cluster: greenfield
    # cdf-project-name: my-project # to suppress python SDK warning (not required for API keys).
  env:
    # API key to be used when running your transformations,
    # As referenced in your transformation manifests
    SOME_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.SOME_API_KEY }}
```

This GitHub Action takes the following inputs:

| Name      | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `path`    | _(Required)_ The path to a directory containing transformation manifests. This is relative to `$GITHUB_WORKSPACE`, which will be the root of the repository when using [actions/checkout](https://github.com/actions/checkout) with default settings. |
| `api-key` | _(Required)_ The API key used for authenticating with transformations. Equivalent to setting the `TRANSFORMATIONS_API_KEY` environment variable. |
| `cluster` | _(Optional)_ The name of the cluster where Transformations is hosted. Equivalent to setting the `TRANSFORMATIONS_CLUSTER` environment variable. |
